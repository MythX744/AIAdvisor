## Project Description
The AI Tools Technology Advisor project is an initiative aimed at delving into
and understanding the diverse world of artificial intelligence tools.
## Project Timeline
The project unfolds in three main stages, beginning with an extensive data collection process. 
A form is distributed to a wide-ranging audience to capture various perspectives and experiences with AI tools.
Following this, the project focuses on data cleaning and analysis. In this phase, the amassed
data is meticulously refined and scrutinized to identify significant trends and usage patterns
of AI tools. The final stage involves developing a user-friendly web application. This application 
is not just a platform for displaying the analytical results from the collected data through graphs and charts;
it also features a unique aspect of providing personalized AI tool suggestions based on user input.
