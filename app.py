distribution. For a light usage it suggests that students may use AI tools occasionally or for
specific tasks rather than as a regular and intensive part of their activities. In addition, for
moderate usage implies that certain students are more actively incorporating AI tools into
their activities, possibly for a broader range of tasks or with a somewhat regular frequency.

Moderate usage of AI tools among employees may signify a strategic and purposeful
integration of artificial intelligence into their workflow. It suggests that organizations are not
merely experimenting with AI but are adopting it in a measured and calculated manner.
